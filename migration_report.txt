RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
Due to the large number of pending migrations and potential conflicts with 
existing schema, the safest approach is to:

1. Apply migrations systematically in chronological order
2. Handle conflicts by checking if objects already exist
3. Skip migrations that would cause errors due to existing schema
4. Document any migrations that cannot be applied

NEXT STEPS:
Run the automated migration application script that will:
- Attempt each pending migration in order
- Log successes and failures
- Provide a final report of what was applied
