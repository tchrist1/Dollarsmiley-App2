BATCH 2 - PART C: AUTH LEAKED PASSWORD PROTECTION
================================================================================

ISSUE
-----
Security Advisor Warning: auth_leaked_password_protection (1 finding)

This warning indicates that Supabase Auth's leaked password protection feature
is not enabled. This feature checks user passwords against known compromised
password databases (like Have I Been Pwned) and prevents users from setting
weak or leaked passwords.

RESOLUTION
----------
This is a configuration setting that must be enabled in the Supabase Dashboard.
It cannot be configured via SQL migrations or code.

MANUAL STEPS TO ENABLE
-----------------------

1. Log in to your Supabase Dashboard
   URL: https://app.supabase.com

2. Navigate to your project
   Select the project: Dollarsmiley

3. Go to Authentication settings
   - Click "Authentication" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Policies" or "Security" tab

4. Enable Leaked Password Protection
   - Look for "Leaked Password Protection" setting
   - Toggle it ON
   - This will enable real-time checking against known leaked passwords

5. Optional: Configure password strength requirements
   - Minimum length: 8 characters (recommended)
   - Require uppercase letters
   - Require numbers
   - Require special characters

VERIFICATION
------------
After enabling this feature:
1. The Security Advisor warning should disappear on next scan
2. Users will be prevented from using compromised passwords
3. Existing users with weak passwords will be prompted to change them on next login

SECURITY IMPACT
----------------
- Prevents account takeover via credential stuffing attacks
- Protects users from using passwords exposed in data breaches
- Improves overall account security posture

NOTES
-----
- This feature requires an active internet connection to check password databases
- There may be a slight delay during password validation
- This is a non-breaking change for existing users
- Passwords are checked securely without exposing them to third parties
